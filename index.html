<hr class="inner-hr"></hr>
<p class="small-col-para early-para">On the outskirts of London in Eton, local farmer Duncan Brindley has formed peculier rivalry with an avian foe. A local swan from a pond nearby to his farm has decided to claim one of Brindley’s plots of land as his own. Despite his best efforts Brindley has not managed to make the swan abandon the plot of land, his efforts to chase the bird away have only resulted in the it’s return shortly after his absence.Any effort to stop the bird from returning also seem to have failed, each time the bird has managed to maneuver each obstacle, with the issue escalating to the point of the plot of land featuring a barbed wire fence, a small ditch moat surrounding the plot, and animal traps hidden throughout the plot.</p>
<h4 class="dinkus">*<span class="dinkus-space"></span>*<span class="dinkus-space"></span>*</h4>
<p class="small-col-para after-para">  As of today the local authorities have become involved in the matter after concerns were raised by local citizens regarding the swan potentially causing a smaller harvest due to crop damage.

<hr class="inner-hr"></hr>
<p class="small-col-para early-para">For the 4 decades the fisheries of Norway and the British Isles have been locked in fierce competition over fishing territories within the Norwegian Sea. Scotsman Markus Boyd was one of many affected, having left for sea in unfavourable conditions due to falling behind on catch targets, Boyd was blown off course and destroyed his ship against the cliff sides of the Norwegian coast. Boyd would go on stay in Norway due to lacking the necessary funds to return home. During his stay Boyd struggled to find work as a result of the language barrier, resulting in him having to slowly hitchhike from Norway to France where he managed to find English speaking fisherman willing to take him across the English channel.</p>

<p class="small-col-para early-para">Some 4 months ago it was uncovered by Jane Lacksnatch that Pastor Arthur Hastings of the Chigwell Evangelical Church has been stealing funds from donations made to the church, resulting in £560 worth of funds being stolen from the church. Miss Lacksnatch has reportedly stated that she discovered this fact when making an unannounced visit to the Pastor to surprise him with a christmas gift. Yesterday morning, Judge David Livingstone charged Pastor Hastings of both misappropriation of funds and theft, with a sentence of 4 months in prison.</p>
<h4 class="dinkus">*<span class="dinkus-space"></span>*<span class="dinkus-space"></span>*</h4>
<p class="small-col-para after-para">This resulted in large outcry from the citizens of Chigwell, claiming that Pastor Hastings was being given a lenient sentence because of his background in the church. Judge Livingstone has refuted this claim and made the argument that Pastor Hastings sentence is no different from a sentence he would give to any other individual convicted of the same crime. Although Judge Livingstone’s claims have been widely disregarded by the local communities as this is not the first time that such accusations have been made against Judge Livingstone. </p>

Thankfully the miners only sustained minor injuries and there the mineshaft didn’t experience any flooding during the collapse, this would mean that chances of survival for the miners were high and that they had time to work with, Although with no means of getting water and food to the miners it still meant that the operation would still need to be finished as soon as possible.</p>
